Above, you will find pages containing my podcasts, blog posts, and final case study for CSCI 263, Computing Ethics and Society, taken during fall of 2025. More information about me can be found below.

About Me
---
My name is Rylie Hansen. I am a junior computer science and math major at St. Olaf College. Go Oles!

Research 
---
During the summer of 2025, I participated in St. Olaf's Collaborative Undergraduate Research and Inquiry (CURI) program. I worked with Professor Will Leeson, along with two other undergraduates, on harnessing query instability to improve SMT solver performance. We are continuing this work during the fall semester of 2025.
 
Personal Life
---
I thoroughly enjoy engaging in music, whether that be through playing the drums for Folkish (a campus band that I'm in) or just listening to songs on my phone. I also love animals, and I dream of one day owning many cats.
