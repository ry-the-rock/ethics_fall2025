This is where you will answer questions related to the assigned case study reading. Think of these responses as a journal of your thoughts—used for note-taking and reflection rather than formal argumentation. Your submissions will be graded, but the focus is on completion and thoughtfulness, not grammar or ``perfect” reasoning. Write in your own words, be authentic, and aim to provide insightful reflections based on your reading.
