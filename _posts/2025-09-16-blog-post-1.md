Some thoughts on the environmental impact of large data centers.

Discussion Questions
---
**Article Justification:** This article caught my eye because of two main reasons: the publisher and the topic. First, I chose an article written by BBC in order to limit the impact of possibly-skewed media sources. BBC ranks well for unbiased reporting, being categorized as either center or left-center ([AllSides](https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias), [Ad Fontes Media](https://adfontesmedia.com/bbc-bias-and-reliability/)). Secondly, I chose this specific article to understand the possible impacts of AI on the environment, especially in developing countries like Mexico ([World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/mexico/overview)) where large data centers exist. This matters to me because I want to become more educated on the larger, global impacts of widescale artificial intelligence usage.

**Ethics Response:** In the BBC article “Thirsty data centres boom in drought-hit Mexico,” technology reporter Suzanne Bearne discusses the effects of Querétaro, Mexico’s large data centers. A main source of ethical tension is sourced from uncertainties about fresh water allocation. Given that these centers require thousands of gallons of fresh water for cooling, some citizens of Querétaro are uneased by the centers’ presence, especially after the city has faced its worst drought in decades.

The citizens of Querétaro represent one stakeholder in this situation. They are the ones who are directly impacted by the data centers’ high levels of water consumption. Many have taken it upon themselves to become activists against this type of situation, thus showing an emphasis on duty/deontological theory, where they are fighting to ensure water’s continuation as a basic human right.

Another stakeholder is the government of Querétaro. They are acting in ways that they believe will benefit the most people in the long run, specifically through economic means. Therefore, they are acting through a lens of utilitarianism.

**Reflection:** I feel that this assignment went as well as it could have. There are still parts that I am unsure about, like how exactly to discuss the ethical frameworks and how to conclude the blog post (if a conclusion is necessary). I tried to make the response flow naturally as a paragraph, but that might have limited me in my ability to further discuss the ethical tensions present in the article. All in all, I just tried my best.
