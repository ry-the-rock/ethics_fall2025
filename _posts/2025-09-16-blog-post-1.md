**Article Justification**

This article caught my eye because of two main reasons: the publisher and the topic. First, I chose an article written by BBC in order to limit the impact of possibly-skewed media sources. BBC ranks well for unbiased reporting, being categorized as either center or left-center ([AllSides](https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias), [Ad Fontes Media](https://adfontesmedia.com/bbc-bias-and-reliability/)). Secondly, I chose this specific article to understand the possible impacts of AI on the environment, especially in developing countries like Mexico ([World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/mexico/overview)) where large data centers exist.
