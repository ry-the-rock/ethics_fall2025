Answering some questions about data-driven exceptions while generating my own.

**Case Study Reading:** [The Right to Be an Exception to a Data-Driven Rule](https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/pub/right-to-be-exception/release/2)

The Discussion
---
**Part 1: Summary**  
The case study *The Right to Be an Exception to a Data-Driven Rule* proposes the idea that data-driven decision aids lack the framework to address exceptions that arise to its given set of rules.  

**Part 2: Going Deeper**  
 A data-driven rule is a rule decision-making aids use to determine the connection between inputs, defined as covariates, and the outputs, defined as recommendations; an exception occurs when a data-driven rule fails and is a type of error because it causes unexpected or incorrect behavior.   

When considering data-driven rules, what is interesting to consider is data that might fall beyond a quantitative scope. Data-driven decisions do not have qualitative standards that support their decisions. For example, let's say that someone is hiring for a graphic design position. Resumes for this type of job should look very different from a standard Harvard resume template in order to show off the applicants' skills and talents. However, the data-decision aid would most likely only make decisions based on the text it can decipher; no decisions would be made based on the resume's visual appeal. I believe that only a human recruiter could have the capability to make a decision that would best benefit the company.  

To reduce the amount of mishandled exceptions caused by data-driven rules, the authors suggest a three section analysis to be performed based on the ideals of individualization, uncertainty, and harm. Specifically, individualization can provide the added benefit of adaptability to a model, but could also possibly increase memory usage. As for uncertainty, three types exist, with aleatoric uncertainty being irreducible. Therefore, uncertainty as a framework is very important, and must be considered when making high stakes decisions due to its incapability of being diminished. 


**Part 3: Going Beyond**  
Considering the increase of data-driven rules providing influence in society, at what point do you think human intervention is needed to make decisions?  
  
I decided on this question because I think it is very interesting to hear people's opinions on essentially when a generated decision becomes 'valid'. If we were to use a hiring example again, some people might wish to remove the influence of technology right at the beginning and only have a human recruiter, thus hinting at the idea that they believe that decisions made by technology aren't valid. Other might say to have a decision aid select a couple of applicants to interview, but still have a human review their qualifications (semi-valid). Of course, there can be a mixed range of responses, and that's why I find it especially thought-provoking.  
 
**Part 4: Reflection**  
I feel better educated on how technology powered by the idea of data-driven decision making can be too generalizing and exploitative to those who might be considered ‘exceptions’. In my opinion, there are certain situations where the adaptability needed for this technology is just too great and should not fully replace human thinking. I could see how it could help address human bias, however. Decisions could possibly become more logical and cohesive with this technology as an aid.
